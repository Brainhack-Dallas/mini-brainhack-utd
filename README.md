## Overview of Brainhack and what we will try to do

### What is "Hacking" in the context of a Brainhack?
The idea is to work on coding something that will become useful to the community. So, this is not necessarily a time to bring data and just work on one’s project for a paper, but more along the line of working on a project that builds a tool/pipeline/shared data.

* e.g., an open-source textbook is a good project for ‘hacking’ time
* e.g., a tool to easily visualize brain network is a good project for ‘hacking’ time
* e.g., an analysis for a paper that is to be submitted soon is NOT a god project for ’hacking time.

It is not to say one shouldn’t ask about analysis questions during the ‘hack’. The whole point is to facilitate an open environment for working on projects, learning, and networking! But don’t treat hacking as a tutoring-session :slightly_smiling_face:

### Hacking & Training
Some regional Brainhacks how offer two tracks. Attendees can focus on “hacking”, where they attend most of the hacking sessions to complete a project. Alternatively, attendees can focus on “training”, where they attend most (or some) of the organized workshops (e.g., Git/GitHub, data visualization, containers, open science, basic of R/Python). In the mini-Brainhack, it doesn't have to be so official, but there can be components of both of these flavors. 

### How organized does this have to be? 
>The most important aspect of the event is sharing and disseminating the information among colleagues from different departments and labs without having any borders or limits. This will help you to develop new collaborations and networks while enjoying and celebrating the practices of open science and gaining recognition to your effort and lab/institute there! *-from Brainhack Global team's email*

There can be talks (some guy/gal talk up  front), workshops (attendees work along), or **un-conference** (the opposite of a formal conference talk, an un-conference is someone or a group of people just talk about an expertise area they are willing to share with the crowd).
