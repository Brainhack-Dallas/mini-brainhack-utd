1,Multivariate Bookdown,Ju-Chi Yu,Ju-Chi.Yu@utdallas.edu,"Create chapter on PCA and CA, with their inference analysis",https://github.com/juchiyu/MultivarBook.git,"The goal of this book is to provide a vignette about the basics and the advanced applications of multivariate analysis. We are hoping to use this book to provide researchers with guidence on applying multivariate techniques (to neuroimaging data). The current aim is to (1) start with simple toy examples to illustrate principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), and also to (2) generate a template for other methods that we hope to include in the future.

2,"Bootstrap, Permutation, APA Statement Bookdown",Ekarin Pongpipat,Ekarin.Pongpipat@utdallas.edu,Create a book on creating a more informative APA statement using bootstrap and permutation testing,https://github.com/epongpipat/boot-perm-apa,"Our current <a href=""https://rpsystats.com"" target=""_blank"">book</a> uses a bare minimum APA statement. However, we would prefer to not promote this and would prefer to promote a ""Gold"" standard APA statement. We believe that the APA statement should include adjusted R-squared as a measure of effect size, its confidence interval (CI), bootstraped CI of the estimates, and permuted p-values. Ideally, in the book, we would write a chapter on each boostrapping, permutation, and then a chapter on APA Gold Standard","R (bookdown), GitHub"
3,EEG Machine Learning,Matt Kmiecik,Matthew.Kmiecik@utdallas.edu,Explore applications of machine learning to electrophysiological data,https://github.com/mkmiecik14/ml-eeg,Two participant groups (controls vs. individuals with alcoholism) were shown images that were either identical or different while their scalp EEG was recorded. This brainhack project will explore ways to visualize event-related potentials (ERPs) and identify features within electrophysiological signals that differentiate how alcoholic from non-alcoholic individuals identify similarities and differences in their visual field.,"R, GitHub, EEGLAB, MATLAB"
