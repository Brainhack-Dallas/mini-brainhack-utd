2,GLM Bookdown,Ekarin Pongpipat,Ekarin.Pongpipat@utdallas.edu,Create chapter on bootstrap and permutation testing and an APA gold standard statement,https://github.com/rpsystats/practical-ext-of-intro-stats-in-psy-using-R,"Our current <a href=""https://rpsystats.com"" target=""_blank"">book</a> uses a bare minimum APA statement. However, we would prefer to not promote this and would prefer to promote a ""Gold"" standard APA statement. We believe that the APA statement should include adjusted R-squared as a measure of effect size, its confidence interval (CI), bootstraped CI of the estimates, and permuted p-values. Ideally, we would write a chapter on boostrapping, permutation, and then a chapter on APA Gold Standard","R (bookdown), GitHub"
